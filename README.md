# Hangman Challenge

## Overview
The Hangman Challenge is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, providing an interactive experience for players.

## Features
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of 500+ words.
- Player input through a simple and intuitive GUI.
- Displays the current state of the word with correctly guessed letters and remaining blanks.
- Tracks incorrect guesses and provides feedback on letters that have already been guessed.
- Clearly displays win/loss conditions and the correct word at the end of the game.
- Automatically restarts a new game after a round concludes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language used for game logic and functionality.
- **Tkinter**: Library used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Random**: Used to randomly select words from a predefined list.

## Installation Instructions
To run the Hangman game, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if it's not available, you may need to install it using your package manager.

### Dependencies
You may need to install Tkinter if it's not already installed. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
# For Python 3
pip install tk
```

## How to Play
1. Launch the game by running the Python script.
2. A hidden word will be displayed as blanks (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _").
3. Enter a single letter in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
4. The game will update the displayed word and track your guesses.
5. If you guess the word correctly or run out of attempts, the game will inform you and automatically start a new game.

## Example Usage
To run the game, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python hangman_game.py
```


## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the classic Hangman game.
- Thanks to the Python community for providing the libraries that made this project possible.

## Future Improvements
- Add a scoring system based on the number of attempts.
- Implement different difficulty levels with varying word lengths and maximum attempts.
- Enhance the GUI with more visual elements and animations.
